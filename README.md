# PC-Tuning

Optimize Windows based systems for real-time tasks

## Introduction

I have tried my best to provide technical references, my own research and a valid justification to the information provided to prevent making changes that would otherwise make your system perform worse than stock but simultaneously also provide a solid baseline for experimenting with settings in the future. Please note that this repository may contain information similar to those of the projects listed in the [Further Reading](#further-reading) section. However, it is not my intention to directly copy from them. In some circumstances it is unavoidable.

The guidance is currently updated and has been tested on Windows 7 through to Windows 11 (x64). See a full list of [issues](https://github.com/amitxv/PC-Tuning/issues).
