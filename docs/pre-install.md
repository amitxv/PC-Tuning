# Pre-Install Instructions

## Configure Partitions

Configure a [dual-boot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-booting) to separate work/bloatware and gaming environments. This way you will not be forced to install bloatware on your gaming partition (such as mouse software as previously mentioned) and full functionality of the operating system will be guaranteed for when you need it. You can do this by [shrinking a volume](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/disk-management/shrink-a-basic-volume) in disk management, which will create unallocated space for the new operating system to be installed to. This will be completely independent of the current operating system.

## Create the Base ISO

Generally, Windows 7 is superior for real-time tasks compared to newer versions of Windows but lacks driver support for modern hardware, so drivers must be integrated manually. In some cases, you may not be able to find USB drivers at all on newer platforms (it is recommended to check if you can get hold of them in advance of building the ISO, see the [Integrate and Obtain Drivers](/docs/building.md#integrate-and-obtain-drivers) section for details on finding drivers). Earlier versions of Windows lack support for GPU drivers and anti-cheats, leaving some users forced to use newer builds. Microsoft implemented a fixed 10 MHz QueryPerformanceFrequency on Windows 10 1809+ which was intended to make developing applications easier, but many users reported worse performance. Windows 10 1903+ has an [updated scheduler for multi CCX Ryzen CPUs](https://i.redd.it/y8nxtm08um331.png). The behavior of processes that are affected by a single process raising the clock interrupt frequency significantly changed in Windows 10 2004+ in a way that potentially breaks real-time applications as explained in [this article](https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2020/10/04/windows-timer-resolution-the-great-rule-change). However, the old implementation can be mimicked in Windows 11+ and Windows 10 Server (not applicable to client editions) with a registry entry. The implementation was [further developed in Windows 11](../media/windows11-timeapi-changes.png) which is an attempt to improve power efficiency.

## Prepare the USB

- Plug in your USB storage and backup any important files. Download [Ventoy](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy) and launch ``Ventoy2Disk.exe``. Navigate to the option menu and select the correct partition style and disable secure boot support if it is not enabled in BIOS, then select your USB storage and click install

    - See [media/identify-bios-mode.png](../media/identify-bios-mode.png)

- Download a live Linux distribution of your choice and move the ISO into the USB storage in file explorer. I will be using [Linux Mint Xfce Edition](https://www.linuxmint.com/download.php)

## Boot into the ISO

For the next steps, it is mandatory to disconnect the Ethernet cable and not be connected to the internet. This will allow us to bypass the forced Microsoft login during OOBE and will prevent Windows from fetching updates. Moving onward, you will need to open [docs/post-install.md](/docs/post-install.md) on another device to follow up until a web browser is installed. After that you can open the guide on the same operating system you are configuring.

- Install using a USB storage device:

    - Move your Windows ISO into the USB storage in file explorer (where the Linux ISO is also located)

    - Boot into Ventoy on your USB in BIOS and select your Windows ISO. Continue with setup as per usual

    - When installing Windows 8 with a USB, you may be required to enter a key. Use the generic key ``GCRJD-8NW9H-F2CDX-CCM8D-9D6T9`` to bypass this step (this does not activate Windows)

    - When installing Windows 11 with a USB, you may encounter system requirement issues. To bypass the checks, press ``Shift+F10`` to open CMD then type ``regedit`` and import ``windows11-setup.reg``

- Install using DISM Apply-Image (without a USB storage device):

    - Create a new partition by [shrinking a volume](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/disk-management/shrink-a-basic-volume) and assign the newly created unallocated space a drive letter. Extract the ISO if required and launch ``install.bat``
