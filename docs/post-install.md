## Remove Bloatware Natively

- Open CMD as administrator and enter the commands below to remove the chromium version of Microsoft Edge (if present) and OneDrive

    - Remove Microsoft Edge

        ```bat
        if exist "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application" (for /f "delims=" %a in ('where /r "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application" *setup.exe*') do ("%a" --uninstall --system-level --verbose-logging --force-uninstall))
        ```

    - Remove OneDrive

        ```bat
        for %a in ("SysWOW64" "System32") do (if exist "%windir%\%~a\OneDriveSetup.exe" ("%windir%\%~a\OneDriveSetup.exe" /uninstall))
        ```

- Although nothing should appear, as a precautionary measure check and uninstall any bloatware that exists by typing ``appwiz.cpl`` in ``Win+R``

- Disable everything except for the following by typing ``OptionalFeatures`` in ``Win+R``. On Windows Server, this has to be accessed via the Server Manager dashboard by navigating to ``Manage -> Remove Roles and Features`` (top right)

    - See [media/windows7-features-example.png](/media/windows7-features-example.png)

    - See [media/windows8+-features-example.png](/media/windows8+-features-example.png)

    - See [media/windows-server-features-example.png](/media/windows-server-features-example.png)

        - To enable Wi-Fi, navigate to ``Manage -> Add Roles and Features`` (top right) and enable ``Wireless LAN Service``

- Windows 10+ Only:

    - Windows 10:

        - Uninstall bloatware in ``Apps -> Apps and Features`` by pressing ``Win+I``

        - In the ``Optional features`` section, uninstall everything apart from ``Microsoft Paint``, ``Notepad`` and ``WordPad`` if applicable (these do not exist in earlier Windows 10 versions)

    - Windows 11:

        - Uninstall bloatware in ``Apps -> Installed apps`` by pressing ``Win+I``

        - In the ``Apps -> Optional features`` section, uninstall everything apart from ``WMIC``, ``Notepad (system)`` and ``WordPad``

- Restart your PC once to apply the changes above (do not boot into Linux without a full restart beforehand)

## Removing Bloatware with Linux

As mentioned previously, the instructions below are specific to Linux Mint. If you are using another distro, interpret the steps below and follow along accordingly.

- Boot into Ventoy on your USB in BIOS and select the Linux ISO

- Open file explorer which is pinned to the taskbar and navigate to the volume Windows is installed on. You can identify this by finding the volume that has the ``win-debloat.sh`` script in

- Right-click an empty space and select ``Open in Terminal`` to open a terminal window in the current directory. Use the command below to run the script

    ```bash
    sudo bash win-debloat.sh
    ```

- Once finished, use the command below to reboot

    ```bash
    reboot
    ```

- You can use Task Manager to check for residual bloatware that is running in the background and possibly create an issue on the repository to let me know that it should be removed. This is difficult to maintain as Microsoft never likes to be consistent

## Disable Residual Scheduled Tasks

Open PowerShell as administrator and enter the command below. To launch with administrator privileges, type ``PowerShell`` in ``Win+R`` then simultaneously press ``Ctrl+Shift+Enter``

```powershell
C:\bin\scripts\disable-scheduled-tasks.ps1
```

## Merge the Registry Files

Open PowerShell as administrator and enter the command below. Replace ``<option>`` with the Windows version you are configuring (e.g. 7, 8, 10, 11).

```powershell
C:\bin\scripts\apply-registry.ps1 -winver <option>
```

- Ensure that the script prints a "successfully applied" message to the console, if it has not then PowerShell was probably not opened with administrator privileges and the registry files were not successfully merged

- Restart your PC through ``Ctrl+Alt+Delete``. After and only after a restart, you can establish an internet connection as the Windows update policies will take effect

## User Preference

Go through the ``C:\bin\preference`` folder to configure common user settings.

## Install Drivers

- Avoid installing chipset drivers

- GPU drivers will be installed in a later step so do not install them at this stage

- You can find drivers by searching for drivers that are compatible with your device HWID. See [media/device-hwid-example.png](/media/device-hwid-example.png) in regard to finding your HWID in device manager for a given device

- Try to obtain the driver in its INF form so that it can be installed in device manager as executable installers usually install other bloatware along with the driver itself. Most of the time, you can extract the installer's executable with 7-Zip to obtain the driver

- I would recommend updating and installing following:

    - NIC

    - [USB](https://winraid.level1techs.com/t/usb-3-0-3-1-drivers-original-and-modded/30871) and [NVMe](https://winraid.level1techs.com/t/recommended-ahci-raid-and-nvme-drivers/28310) (both should already be installed if configuring Windows 7)

        - See [Microsoft USB driver latency penalty](/docs/research.md#microsoft-usb-driver-latency-penalty)

    - [SATA](https://winraid.level1techs.com/t/recommended-ahci-raid-and-nvme-drivers/28310) (required on Windows 7 as enabling MSI on the stock SATA driver will result in a BSOD)

- Since we do not have browser access at this stage, download them on another operating system or PC

## Configure a [Web Browser](https://privacytests.org)

A standard Firefox installation is recommended. Open PowerShell and enter the command below.

```powershell
C:\bin\scripts\install-firefox.ps1
```

- On Firefox, after configuring extensions, I usually customize/cleanup the interface further in ``Menu Settings -> More tools -> Customize toolbar`` then skim through ``about:preferences``. The [Arkenfox user.js](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js) can also be imported, see the [wiki](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki)

## Install Visual C++ Redistributable Runtimes

Download and install the [Visual C++ redistributable runtimes](https://github.com/abbodi1406/vcredist).

## Install .NET 4.8 Runtimes

Download and install the [.NET 4.8 runtimes](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48).

## Spectre, Meltdown and CPU Microcode

- Disable Spectre and Meltdown with [InSpectre](https://www.grc.com/inspectre.htm)

    - AMD is unaffected by Meltdown and apparently [performs better with Spectre enabled](https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-zen4-spectrev2)

    - A minority of anticheats (FACEIT) require Meltdown to be enabled

- Open CMD with ``C:\bin\NSudo.exe`` and enter the commands below to remove the CPU microcode updates

    ```bat
    del /f /q C:\Windows\System32\mcupdate_GenuineIntel.dll
    ```

    ```bat
    del /f /q C:\Windows\System32\mcupdate_AuthenticAMD.dll
    ```

- Reboot and use [InSpectre](https://www.grc.com/inspectre.htm) and [CPU-Z's](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html) validation feature to check the status after a reboot

    - See [media/meltdown-spectre-example.png](/media/meltdown-spectre-example.png)

    - See [media/cpu-z-vulnerable-microcode.png](/media/cpu-z-vulnerable-microcode.png)

## Install 7-Zip

Download and install [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org). Open ``C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7zFM.exe`` then navigate ``Tools -> Options`` and associate 7-Zip with all file extensions by clicking the ``+`` button. You may need to click it twice to override existing associated extensions.

## Configure the Graphics Driver

- See [docs/configure-nvidia.md](/docs/configure-nvidia.md)

- See [docs/configure-amd.md](/docs/configure-amd.md)

## Install DirectX Runtimes

Download and install the [DirectX runtimes](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=8109).

## Configure MSI Afterburner

If you usually use [MSI Afterburner](https://www.msi.com/Landing/afterburner/graphics-cards) to configure the clock/memory frequency, fan speed and other settings, download and install it.

- Disable update checks in settings

- I would recommend configuring a static fan speed as using the fan curve feature requires the program to run continually

- To automatically load profile 1 (as an example) and exit, type ``shell:startup`` in ``Win+R`` then create a shortcut with a target of ``"C:\Program Files (x86)\MSI Afterburner\MSIAfterburner.exe" /Profile1 /Q``

## Configure CRU

You should have already found a stable overclock for your display in the [Physical Setup](/docs/physical-setup.md) section. Download and extract [Custom Resolution Utility](https://www.monitortests.com/forum/Thread-Custom-Resolution-Utility-CRU).

- See [How to set up Display Scaling, works with all games | KajzerD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50itBs-sz1w)

- Aim for an "actual" integer refresh rate (e.g 60.000 not 60.002). Using the exact timing can help achieve this

- Try to delete every resolution and the other bloatware (audio blocks) apart from your native resolution, this may be a workaround for the 1-second black screen when alt-tabbing in exclusive fullscreen, feel free to skip this step if you are not comfortable risking a black screen

- Restart your PC instead of using ``restart64.exe`` as it may result in a black screen

- Ensure your resolution is configured properly in Display Adapter Settings

## Install Open-Shell (Windows 8+)

- Download and install [Open-Shell](https://github.com/Open-Shell/Open-Shell-Menu). Only install the ``Open-Shell Menu``

- Settings I personally use as per section:

    - Skin

        - Midnight

        - Show user picture - Disable

        - Transparency level - Opaque

    - Main Menu

        - Show recent or frequent programs - Don't show

        - Enable hybrid shutdown - Disable

    - General Behavior

        - Check for Windows updates on shutdown - Disable

- Windows 8 Only:

    - Open ``"C:\Program Files\Open-Shell\Start Menu Settings.lnk"``, enable ``Show all settings`` then navigate to the Windows 8 Settings section and set ``Disable active corners`` to ``All``

## Install a Media Player

- [mpv](https://mpv.io) or [mpv.net](https://github.com/stax76/mpv.net)

- [mpc-hc](https://mpc-hc.org) ([alternative link](https://github.com/clsid2/mpc-hc))

- [VLC](https://www.videolan.org)

## Configure Power Options

Open CMD and enter the commands below.

- Set active power scheme to High performance

    ```bat
    powercfg /setactive 8c5e7fda-e8bf-4a96-9a85-a6e23a8c635c
    ```

- Remove the Balanced power scheme

    ```bat
    powercfg /delete 381b4222-f694-41f0-9685-ff5bb260df2e
    ```

- Remove the Power Saver power scheme

    ```bat
    powercfg /delete a1841308-3541-4fab-bc81-f71556f20b4a
    ```

- USB 3 Link Power Management - Off

    ```bat
    powercfg /setacvalueindex scheme_current 2a737441-1930-4402-8d77-b2bebba308a3 d4e98f31-5ffe-4ce1-be31-1b38b384c009 0
    ```

- USB Selective Suspend - Disabled

    ```bat
    powercfg /setacvalueindex scheme_current 2a737441-1930-4402-8d77-b2bebba308a3 48e6b7a6-50f5-4782-a5d4-53bb8f07e226 0
    ```

- Turn off display after - 0 minutes

    ```bat
    powercfg /setacvalueindex scheme_current 7516b95f-f776-4464-8c53-06167f40cc99 3c0bc021-c8a8-4e07-a973-6b14cbcb2b7e 0
    ```

- Set the active scheme as the current scheme

    ```bat
    powercfg /setactive scheme_current
    ```

## Configure the BCD Store

Open CMD and enter the commands below.

- Disable the boot manager timeout when dual booting (does not affect single boot times)

    ```bat
    bcdedit /timeout 0
    ```

- [Data Execution Prevention](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/memory/data-execution-prevention) is set to ``Turn on for essential Windows programs and services only`` by default. However, DEP can be completely disabled with the command below but a minority of anticheats require DEP to be left on the default setting. Do not change if unsure

    ```bat
    bcdedit /set nx AlwaysOff
    ```

- Configure the operating system name, I usually name it to whatever Windows version I am using e.g. Windows 10 1803

    ```bat
    bcdedit /set {current} description "OSNAME"
    ```

- Windows 8+ Only

    - Implemented as a power saving feature for laptops and tablets, you absolutely do not want a [tickless kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tickless_kernel) on a desktop

        ```bat
        bcdedit /set disabledynamictick yes
        ```

## Replace Task Manager with Process Explorer

This step is not optional as the performance counter driver will be disabled which breaks the stock Task Manager functionality.

<details>

<summary>Reasons not to use Task Manager</summary>

- It relies on a kernel mode driver to operate (additional overhead)

- Does not display process tree

- On Windows 8+, [Task Manager reports CPU utility in %](https://aaron-margosis.medium.com/task-managers-cpu-numbers-are-all-but-meaningless-2d165b421e43) which provides misleading CPU utilization details, on the other hand, Windows 7's Task Manager and Process Explorer report time-based busy utilization. This also explains why the disable idle power setting results in 100% CPU utilization on Windows 8+

</details>

- Download and extract [Process Explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer)

- Copy ``procexp64.exe`` into ``C:\Windows`` and open it

- Navigate to ``Options`` and select ``Replace Task Manager`` I also configure the following:

    - Confirm Kill

    - Allow Only One Instance

    - Always On Top (helpful for when applications crash and UI becomes unresponsive)

## Configure Memory Management Settings (Windows 8+)

- Open PowerShell and enter the command below

    ```powershell
    Get-MMAgent
    ```

- If anything is set to True, use the command below as an example to disable a given setting

    ```powershell
    Disable-MMAgent -MemoryCompression
    ```

## Configure the Network Adapter

- Open ``Network and Sharing Center -> Change adapter settings`` by typing ``control`` in ``Win+R``

- Disable any unused network adapters then right-click your main one and select properties

- Disable all items except ``QoS Packet Scheduler`` and ``Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)``

- [Configure a Static IP address](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=36&v=5iRp1Nug0PU). This is required as we will be disabling the network services that waste resources

- Disable ``NetBIOS over TCP/IP`` in ``General -> Advanced -> WINS`` to [prevent unnecessary system listening](https://github.com/djdallmann/GamingPCSetup/blob/master/CONTENT/DOCS/NETWORK/README.md)

## Configure Audio Devices

- The sound control panel can be opened by typing ``mmsys.cpl`` in ``Win+R``

- Disable unused Playback and Recording devices

- Disable audio enhancements as they waste resources

    - See [media/audio enhancements-benchmark.png](/media/audio%20enhancements-benchmark.png)

- Disable Exclusive Mode in the Advanced section

- Set the option in the communications tab to Do nothing

- I also like to set the sound scheme to no sounds in the sounds tab

- Consider using [REAL](https://github.com/miniant-git/REAL) or [LowAudioLatency](https://github.com/spddl/LowAudioLatency) to minimize the size of the audio buffer. Beware of audio dropouts due to CPU not being able to keep up under load

    - Be warned regarding CPU 0 being reserved/underutilized with the usage of the mentioned programs

## Configure Services and Drivers

I am not responsible if anything goes wrong or you BSOD. The idea is to disable services while gaming and use default services for everything else. Feel free to customize the lists by editing ``C:\bin\minimal-services.ini`` in a text editor. There are several comments in the config file you can read to check if you need a given service. As an example, a user with Ethernet does not need the Wi-Fi services enabled.

- The ``High precision event timer`` device in device manager uses IRQ 0 on the majority of AMD systems and consequently conflicts with the ``System timer`` device which also uses IRQ 0. The only way that I'm aware of to resolve this conflict is to disable the parent device of the ``System timer`` device which is ``PCI standard ISA bridge`` by disabling the ``msisadrv`` driver (edit the config)

- Use the command below to prevent the [Software Protection service attempting to register a restart every 30s](/media/software-protection-error.png) while services are disabled. I'm not sure what the problematic service is, but online sources point to Task Scheduler

    ```bat
    reg.exe add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SoftwareProtectionPlatform" /v "InactivityShutdownDelay" /t REG_DWORD /d "4294967295" /f
    ```

- On Win10 1503 - 1703, delete the ``ErrorControl`` registry key in ``HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Schedule`` to prevent an unresponsive explorer shell after disabling the Task Scheduler service

- Use [Autoruns](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns) to remove entries with a yellow label in the ``Services`` section to prevent obsolete services from being added to the scripts that are going to be built in the next steps

- Download and extract the latest [service-list-builder](https://github.com/amitxv/service-list-builder/releases) release. Open CMD and CD to the extracted folder where the executable is located

- Use the command below to build the scripts in the ``build`` folder. Move the build folder somewhere safe such as ``C:\`` and do not share it with other people as it is specific to your system. Note that NSudo with the ``Enable All Privileges`` option is required to run the batch scripts

    ```bat
    service-list-builder.exe --config C:\bin\minimal-services.ini
    ```

- If desired, you can use [ServiWin](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/serviwin.html) to check for residual drivers and possibly create an issue on the repository to let me know that a given driver should be disabled

## Configure Device Manager

The section is directly related to the [Configure Services and Drivers](#configure-services-and-drivers) section. The methodology below will ensure maximum compatibility while services are enabled because devices with an associated driver will be toggled in the ``Services-Disable.bat`` script which means we do not need to permanently disable them

1. If you haven't disabled services at this stage, run the ``Services-Disable.bat`` script

2. Open device manager by typing ``devmgmt.msc`` in ``Win+R``

3. **DO NOT** disable any devices with a yellow icon because these are the devices that are being handled by disabling services

4. Navigate to ``View -> Devices by connection``

    - Disable any PCIe, SATA, NVMe and USB controllers with nothing connected to them

    - Unnecessary HID devices can be disabled, but mouse software will not work

        - See [media/hid-devices-example.png](/media/hid-devices-example.png)

    - Disable write-cache buffer flushing on all drives in the ``Properties -> Policies`` section

    - Navigate to your ``Network adapter -> Properties -> Advanced`` and disable any power saving features. Disable the power saving option in the ``Power Management`` section

    - Disable everything that isn't the GPU on the same PCIe port

5. Navigate to ``View -> Resources by connection``

    - Disable any unneeded devices that are using an IRQ or I/O resources, always ask if unsure and take your time on this step

    - If there are multiple of the same devices, and you are unsure which one is in use, refer back to the tree structure in ``View -> Devices by connection``. Remember that a single device can use many resources. You can also use [MSI Utility](https://forums.guru3d.com/threads/windows-line-based-vs-message-signaled-based-interrupts-msi-tool.378044) to check for duplicate, unneeded devices in case you accidentally miss any with the confusing device manager tree structure

6. Run the ``Services-Enable.bat`` script

7. Open device manager by typing ``devmgmt.msc`` in ``Win+R``

8. Now you **CAN** disable devices with a yellow icon because these are devices that *actually* have errors and are not due to services being disabled

9. Optionally use [DeviceCleanup](https://www.uwe-sieber.de/files/DeviceCleanup.zip) to remove hidden devices

## Disable Driver Power Saving

Open PowerShell and enter the command below to disable power saving on devices in device manager.

```powershell
C:\bin\scripts\disable-pnp-powersaving.ps1
```

## Configure Event Trace Sessions

Create registry files to toggle event trace sessions. Programs that rely on event tracers such will not be able to log data until the required sessions are restored which is the purpose of creating two registry files to toggle between them (identical concept to the service scripts). Open CMD and enter the commands below to build the registry files in the ``C:\`` directory. As with the services scripts these registry files must be run with NSudo. The sessions can be viewed by typing ``perfmon`` in ``Win+R`` then navigating to ``Data Collector Sets -> Event Trace Sessions``.

- ets-enable

    ```bat
    reg.exe export "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\WMI\Autologger" "C:\ets-enable.reg"
    ```

- ets-disable

    ```bat
    >> "C:\ets-disable.reg" echo Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 && >> "C:\ets-disable.reg" echo. && >> "C:\ets-disable.reg" echo [-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\WMI\Autologger]
    ```

- Disable SleepStudy (UserNotPresentSession)

    ```bat
    for %a in ("SleepStudy" "Kernel-Processor-Power" "UserModePowerService") do (wevtutil sl Microsoft-Windows-%~a/Diagnostic /e:false)
    ```

## Optimize the File System

Open CMD and enter the commands below.

- Disables the creation of 8.3 character-length file names on FAT- and NTFS-formatted volumes

    ```bat
    fsutil behavior set disable8dot3 1
    ```

- Disable updates to the Last Access Time stamp on each directory when directories are listed on an NTFS volume

    ```bat
    fsutil behavior set disablelastaccess 1
    ```

- Enables delete notifications (also known as trim or unmap), should be enabled by default, but it is here for safe measure

    ```bat
    fsutil behavior set disabledeletenotify 0
    ```

## Message Signaled Interrupts

[Message signaled interrupts are faster than traditional line-based interrupts and may also resolve the issue of shared interrupts which are often the cause of high interrupt latency and stability](https://repo.zenk-security.com/Linux%20et%20systemes%20d.exploitations/Windows%20Internals%20Part%201_6th%20Edition.pdf).

- Download and open [MSI Utility](https://forums.guru3d.com/threads/windows-line-based-vs-message-signaled-based-interrupts-msi-tool.378044) or [GoInterruptPolicy](https://github.com/spddl/GoInterruptPolicy)

- Enable Message Signaled Interrupts on all devices that support it

    - You will BSOD if you enable MSIs for the stock Windows 7 SATA driver which you should have already updated as mentioned in the [Install Drivers](#install-drivers) section

- Be careful as to what you choose to prioritize. As an example, you will likely stutter in an open-world game that utilizes texture streaming if the GPU IRQ priority is set higher than the storage controller priority. For this reason, you can set all devices to undefined/normal priority

- Restart your PC, you can verify whether a device is utilizing MSIs by checking if it has a negative IRQ in MSI Utility

    - If ``System timer`` and ``High precision event timer`` are sharing IRQ 0, See the [Configure Services and Drivers](#configure-services-and-drivers) section for a solution

- Although this carried out in the [Physical Setup](/docs/physical-setup.md) section, confirm that there is no IRQ sharing on your system by typing ``msinfo32`` in ``Win+R`` then navigating to the ``Conflicts/Sharing`` section

## Interrupt Affinity

By default, CPU 0 handles the majority of DPCs and ISRs for several devices which can be viewed in a xperf dpcisr trace. This is not desirable as there will be a latency penalty because many processes and system activities are scheduled on the same core competing for CPU time. We can set an interrupt affinity policy to the USB, GPU, NIC, HD Audio and storage driver, which are few of many devices responsible for the most DPCs/ISRs, to offload them onto another core. The device can be identified by cross-checking the ``Location Info`` with the ``Location`` in the ``Properties -> General`` section of a device in device manager. Restart your PC instead of the driver to avoid issues.

Ensure that the [corresponding DPC for an ISR are processed on the same CPU](/media/isr-dpc-same-core.png). Additional overhead can be introduced if they are processed on different CPUs due to increased inter-processor communication and interfering with cache coherence.

- Ensure that the interrupt affinity policies have been configured correctly by analyzing a xperf trace while the device is busy

- Use [Microsoft Interrupt Affinity Tool](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/microsoft-interrupt-affinity-tool) or [GoInterruptPolicy](https://github.com/spddl/GoInterruptPolicy) to configure driver affinities

- Use [AutoGpuAffinity](https://github.com/amitxv/AutoGpuAffinity) to benchmark the GPU affinity

- Use [Mouse Tester](https://github.com/microe1/MouseTester) to compare polling variation between the USB controller on different cores

    - Use the ``Interval vs Time`` graph (frequency = 1000 / interval)

    - Ideally this should be benchmarked during realistic load such as a game running in the background as idle benchmarks are misleading but as we do not have any games installed yet, you can and benchmark this later

- Open CMD and enter the command below to configure what CPU handles DPCs/ISRs for the network driver. Ensure to change the driver key to suit your needs. Keep in mind that RSS queues determine the amount of consecutive cores ndis.sys is processed on. For example, ndis.sys will be processed on CPU 2/3/4/5 (or 2/4/6/8 with HT/SMT enabled) if RssBaseProcNumber is set to 2 with 4 RSS queues configured. [The NIC must support MSI-X for RSS to function properly](https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/9uc03d/the_i219v_nic_on_your_new_z390_motherboard_and).

    - See [How many RSS Queues do you need?](research.md#how-many-rss-queues-do-you-need)

    - See [media/find-driver-key-example.png](/media/find-driver-key-example.png) to obtain the correct driver key in device manager

        ```bat
        reg.exe add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4d36e972-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\0000" /v "*RssBaseProcNumber" /t REG_SZ /d "2" /f
        ```

## Raise the Clock Interrupt Frequency (Timer Resolution)

There is a lot of misleading and inaccurate information regarding this topic polluting the internet along with people having no idea what it influences. Raising the timer resolution helps with precision where constant sleeping or pacing is required such as multimedia applications, frame rate limiters and more. Below is a list of bullet points highlighting key information regarding the topic.

- Applications that require a high resolution already call for 1ms (1000hz) most of the time. In the context of a multimedia application, this means that it can maintain the pace of events within a resolution of 1ms, but we can take advantage of 0.5ms (2000hz) being the maximum resolution supported on most systems

- The implementation of timer resolution changed in Windows 10 2004+ so that the calling process does not affect the system on a global level but can be restored on Windows Server and Windows 11+ as explained [here](/docs/research.md#fixing-timing-precision-in-windows-after-the-great-rule-change) with the registry key below. As long as the process that requires high precision is calling for a higher resolution, this does not matter. Although, it limits us from raising the resolution beyond 1ms (unless you have a kernel mode driver which is a topic for another day)

    ```
    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\kernel]
    "GlobalTimerResolutionRequests"=dword:00000001
    ```

- Even if you do not want to raise the timer resolution beyond 1ms, it is useful to call for it nonetheless as old applications do not raise the resolution when they should

- Higher resolution results in higher precision, but in some cases 0.5ms provides less precision than something slightly lower such as 0.507ms. You should benchmark what calling resolution provides the highest precision (lowest deltas) in the [MeasureSleep](https://github.com/amitxv/TimerResolution/releases/tag/MeasureSleep) program while requesting different resolutions with the [SetTimerResolution](https://github.com/amitxv/TimerResolution/releases/tag/SetTimerResolution) program. This should be carried out under load while running something CPU/memory/cache intensive such as linpack as idle benchmarks may be misleading

    - See [Micro-adjusting timer resolution for higher precision](/docs/research.md#micro-adjusting-timer-resolution-for-higher-precision) for a detailed explanation

## Configure Control Panel

It is not a bad idea to skim through both the legacy and immersive control panel to ensure nothing is misconfigured.

## Analyze Event Viewer

This step is not required, but can help to justify unexplained performance issues. From a developer's perspective, we have certainly "broken" the operating system as we are running minimal services, debloated Windows and more. Code that naturally depends on something that is disabled or removed will throw errors or get stuck in an error loop. We can use event viewer to inspect whether everything is running as it should be. This is the method I used to identify that the [Software Protection service was attempting to register a restart every 30s](/media/software-protection-error.png) as explained in the [Configure Services and Drivers](#configure-services-and-drivers) section (along with the solution).

- The ``Services-Disable.bat`` script disables logging, so the start values for ``Wecsvc`` and ``EventLog`` must be changed to 3 and 2 respectively

- After running the script, use your PC normally for a while then open event viewer by typing ``eventvwr.msc`` in ``Win+R``. Inspect each section for errors and investigate how they can be solved

- Once finished, set the ``Wecsvc`` and ``EventLog`` start values back to 4 in the ``Services-Disable.bat`` script

## Configuring Games and Applications

Install any programs and game launchers you commonly use to prepare us for the next steps.

- Consider [NVIDIA Reflex](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/reflex-low-latency-platform) if your game has support for it

- Cap your frame rate at a multiple of your monitor refresh rate to prevent [frame mistiming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_73gFgNrYVQ). E.g. possible frame rate caps with a 144Hz monitor include 72, 144, 288, 432. Consider capping at your minimum fps threshold for increased smoothness and ensure the GPU is not maxed out as [lower GPU utilization reduces system latency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZRuFaFZh5M&t=859s)

    - Capping your frame rate with [RTSS](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/rtss-rivatuner-statistics-server-download.html) instead of the in-game limiter will result in consistent frame pacing and a smoother experience but at the cost of [noticeably higher latency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=377&v=T2ENf9cigSk) but disabling ``passive waiting`` in the settings page marginally helps with that. Disabling the ``Enable dedicated encoder server service`` setting also prevents ``EncoderServer.exe`` running which wastes resources

- Configure present mode

    - Always check whether the game is using the desired present mode with PresentMon. ``Hardware: Legacy Flip`` (exclusive fullscreen) and ``Hardware: Independent Flip`` (fullscreen optimizations) are optimal

    - Assuming the ``Disable fullscreen optimizations`` checkbox is ticked, and you are having trouble with using ``Hardware: Legacy Flip``, try to run the command below in CMD and reboot

        ```bat
        reg.exe add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\System\GameConfigStore" /v "GameDVR_DXGIHonorFSEWindowsCompatible" /t REG_DWORD /d "1" /f
        ```

    - If you are stuck with ``Hardware Composed: Independent Flip``, try to run the command below to disable MPOs in CMD and reboot

        ```bat
        reg.exe add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Dwm" /v "OverlayTestMode" /t REG_DWORD /d "5" /f
        ```

- Configuring QoS policies

    - This allows Windows to prioritize packets of an application

    - See [media/dscp-46-qos-policy.png](/media/dscp-46-qos-policy.png)

        - See [How can you verify if a DSCP QoS policy is working?](research.md#how-can-you-verify-if-a-dscp-policy-is-working)

## Cleanup

- Use [Autoruns](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns) to remove any unwanted programs such as game launchers. Remove all obsolete entries with a yellow label and run with ``C:\bin\NSudo.exe`` if you encounter any permission errors

- Some locations you may want to review for leftover bloatware and unwanted shortcuts

    - ``"C:\"``

    - ``"C:\Windows\Prefetch"``

    - ``"C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\download"``

    - ``"C:\Windows\Temp"``

    - ``"%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Temp"``

    - ``"%userprofile%\Downloads"``

- Clear the PATH user environment variable of locations pointing to Windows bloatware folders

- Configure Disk Cleanup

    - Open CMD and enter the command below, tick all the boxes, press ``OK``

        ```bat
        cleanmgr /sageset:50
        ```

    - Run Disk Cleanup

        ```bat
        cleanmgr /sagerun:50
        ```

- Reset Firewall rules

    - Open CMD and enter the commands below

        ```bat
        reg.exe delete "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\SharedAccess\Parameters\FirewallPolicy\FirewallRules" /f && reg.exe add "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\SharedAccess\Parameters\FirewallPolicy\FirewallRules" /f
        ```

## Final Thoughts and Tips

- Avoid applying random tweaks, using tweaking programs or fall for the "fps boost" marketing nonsense. If you have a question about a specific option or setting, just ask

- Try to favor free and open source software. Stay away from proprietary software where you can and ensure to scan files with [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) before running them

- Consider removing your game off the GPU core by setting an affinity to the game process to prevent them being serviced on the same CPU as [this improves frame pacing](/media/isolate-gpu-core.png). Your mileage may vary, but it is definitely something worth mentioning

- Favor tools such as [Bulk-Crap-Uninstaller](https://github.com/Klocman/Bulk-Crap-Uninstaller) to uninstall programs as the regular control panel does not remove residual files  

- Kill processes that waste resources such as game clients and ``explorer.exe``

    - Use ``Ctrl+Shift+Esc`` to open process explorer then use ``File -> Run`` to start the ``explorer.exe`` shell again

- Consider disabling idle states to force C-State 0 with the commands below before launching a game and enable idle after you close your game. This will mitigate jitter due to the process of state transition. Beware of higher temperatures and power consumption. The CPU temperature should not increase to the point of thermal throttling because you should have already dealt with that in [docs/physical-setup.md](/docs/physical-setup.md). 0 is idle enabled, 1 is idle disabled

    ```bat
    powercfg /setacvalueindex scheme_current sub_processor 5d76a2ca-e8c0-402f-a133-2158492d58ad 1 && powercfg /setactive scheme_current
    ```

- If you are using Windows 8.1+ and [Hardware: Legacy Flip](https://github.com/GameTechDev/PresentMon#csv-columns) (exclusive fullscreen) with your game, you can disable DWM using the scripts in ``C:\bin\scripts\dwm-scripts`` as the process wastes resources despite there being no composition. Beware of the UI breaking and some games/programs will not be able to launch (you may need to disable hardware acceleration)
